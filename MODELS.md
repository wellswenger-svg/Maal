## 1. Model Registry schema

Every model record **must** store:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `model_id` | Stable logical id, e.g. `backbone.flux_kontext_dev_fp8` |
| `version` | Upstream / pack version string |
| `filename` | On-disk filename expected by Comfy |
| `download_source` | Hugging Face / official URL(s) |
| `vram_mb` | Approximate load VRAM |
| `disk_mb` | Approximate disk footprint |
| `license` | SPDX or named license + commercial caveat |
| `compatible_workflows` | List of `workflow_ref` or logical workflow ids |
| `replacement_candidates` | Ordered `model_id`s to try on load failure / upgrades |
| `benchmark_score` | 0–100 engine rubric (see §2) |
| `role` | backbone / vlm / grounding / seg / matting / identity / upscale / vae / text_encoder / control / video / misc |
| `quantization` | fp16 / fp8 / gguf-Q5 / awq / etc. |
| `status` | `installed` \| `missing` \| `outdated` \| `disabled` |

Model Manager uses this registry for ensure/load/unload/health. Workflow Registry and Planner reference **logical slots / `model_id`s**, never raw filenames in planner code.

### Logical slots (indirection)

Some roles are referenced by **slot id** so architecture code stays stable when vendors change:

| Slot | Resolved by | Initial binding (changeable in registry only) |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `planner.default_model` | Model Manager at VLM plan time | e.g. concrete `vlm.qwen25_vl_7b` record → swap to Qwen3-VL later without editing Planner |
| Workflow `preferred_models` / `compatible_models` / `minimum_models` | Model Manager at execute bind | See WORKFLOWS.md |

Planner source must call `ModelManager.resolve("planner.default_model")`, not embed `vlm.qwen25_vl_7b`.

---

## 2. Benchmark score rubric (engine-defined)

`benchmark_score` is **not** a marketing rating. Compute as weighted sum on internal fixtures (0–100):

| Component | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Task fitness | 30 | How well it serves its role on fixtures |
| Stability on 16GB | 25 | OOM rate, peak VRAM |
| Speed | 15 | Relative to role baseline |
| License fit | 10 | Commercial clarity for product |
| Ecosystem/Comfy support | 10 | Native nodes vs fragile forks |
| Quality delta vs prior | 10 | Measured metric improvement |

Scores below are **initial estimates** until fixtures run; mark `estimated: true` in implementation.

---

## 3. Comparison tables by capability

Format required for each capability: Best · Second-best · VRAM · Speed · Quality · License · Advantages · Limitations · Why selected.

### 3.1 Planner VLM (bound via slot `planner.default_model`)

Architecture code never hardcodes a vendor VLM id. The registry maps:

```yaml
slot: planner.default_model
target_model_id: vlm.qwen25_vl_7b   # change this one field to adopt Qwen3-VL etc.
```

| Field | Best (initial target_model_id) | Second-best (replacement_candidates) |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Model | **Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct** (AWQ/GPTQ or bf16+offload) | Qwen2.5-VL-3B / InternVL3-8B / future Qwen3-VL |
| VRAM | ~8–12GB bf16; ~5–7GB quant | ~3–6GB |
| Speed | Medium (seconds–low tens) | Faster |
| Quality | Strong structured plans + grounding language | Weaker multi-step plans |
| License | Qwen / Tongyi terms (verify commercial) | Varies (InternVL often more permissive) |
| Advantages | JSON planning, spatial language, 16GB-feasible sequentially | Lower VRAM, faster bypass path |
| Limitations | Must unload before diffusion; not a segmenter | More planner errors |
| **Why selected (initial)** | Best plan quality that still fits sequential 16GB workflow; **swap via slot**, not code | |

Florence-2 is **not** the planner; it is perception inside graphs.

### 3.2 Fast caption / auxiliary perception

|-------|------|-------------|
| Model | **SAM 2.1** (Large if VRAM allows else Base) | SAM 2.1 Base / emerging SAM3 when Comfy-stable |
| VRAM | Base ~1–2GB; Large higher | Lower |
| Speed | Fast given boxes | Faster |
| Quality | Excellent boundaries | Slightly weaker |
| License | SAM license (Meta) | Same family |

| Quality | Strong instruction edits / consistency | Weaker localized instruction following |
| License | **Non-commercial** (Dev) — product must enforce | Non-commercial Flux Dev terms |
| Advantages | Built for edit instructions | Already installed |
| Limitations | License; multi-turn degradation | Global denoise bleed |
| **Why selected** | Best local instruction-edit backbone in 2026 Comfy ecosystem | |

**Reject as optimal sole editor:** current global Flux Dev img2img-only pipeline.

### 3.7 Surgical inpaint / masked edit

| Field | Best | Second-best |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Model | **FLUX.1 Fill / Tools Fill** | Masked Flux Dev / Kontext+mask hybrid |

| **Why selected** | Best available on-machine identity for Flux edits | |

### 3.9 Face swap (only for `edit.face_swap`)

| Field | Best | Second-best |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Model | **ReActor + InsightFace inswapper_128** (installed) | PuLID-only reidentity (not true swap) |
| VRAM | Low–moderate | — |
| Speed | Fast | — |
| Quality | True swap | Identity edit ≠ swap |
| License | InsightFace / ReActor terms (often non-commercial / restrictive) | — |
| Advantages | Already installed | — |
| Limitations | Ethics/license; artifacts | Wrong tool for “edit expression” |
| **Why selected** | Only when planner task is explicit face swap | |

### 3.10 Face restore

|-------|------|-------------|
| Model | **CodeFormer** (installed) | GFPGANv1.4 (installed) |

|-------|------|-------------|
| Model | **4x-UltraSharp** + UltimateSDUpscale (installed pack) | SeedVR2 (evaluate) / SUPIR (heavy) |
| VRAM | Low–medium tiles | SeedVR2 higher; SUPIR often too heavy for 16GB |
| Speed | Fast–medium | Slower |
| Quality | Strong practical upscale | Potentially higher with SeedVR2 |
| License | UltraSharp community; USDU pack | Per model |
| Advantages | On disk; fits 16GB tiled | Modern |

### 3.13 Image-to-video backbone

| Field | Best | Second-best |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Model | **Wan 2.2 I2V-A14B** fp8 dual high/low (installed) | Wan 2.2 TI2V-5B (installed) |
| VRAM | Tight on 16GB; fp8 + sequential + modest res | Easier 720p attempts |

```

## 6. Replacement policy

When Model Manager load fails:

1. Try `replacement_candidates` in order  
2. If replacement changes quality class, attach `meta.model_degraded=true`  
3. If all fail → error with `download_source` and disk/VRAM needs  
4. Upgrades (Kontext → future successor): add new `model_id`, point workflows’ required_models to new id, keep old as candidate — **no API/UI change**

---

## 7. Disk / VRAM planning (16GB machine)

Rough additional downloads for P1 (order of magnitude):

- Kontext fp8 ~10–12GB  
- Flux Fill ~10–12GB (if separate)  
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B quant ~5–8GB  
- SAM2 + GroundingDINO ~1–3GB  
- BiRefNet ~1GB  
- ControlNet + clip_vision ~1–5GB  

Operators should plan **≥100GB free** beyond current shared model store for comfortable P1+P2.

Peak runtime VRAM must stay within sequential policy; Ultra profiles that exceed ~14GB estimated peak are invalid registrations.

Live totals are exposed at `/api/health` → `ai_engine.health.disk` (Phase 7).

## 8. Phase 7 scorecard (estimated)

All scores below are **`benchmark_estimated: true`** until GPU fixtures promote them. Source of truth in code: `backend/ai_engine/ops/scorecard.py`.

### Models (selected)

| model_id | score | disk_mb est | status intent |
|----------|------:|------------:|---------------|
| backbone.flux_dev_fp8 | 74 | 12000 | installed (runtime) |
| backbone.flux_kontext_dev_fp8 | 78 | 12000 | missing (preferred edit) |
| video.wan22_i2v_high_fp8 | 80 | 14000 | installed |
| video.wan22_ti2v_5b | 68 | 10000 | installed (fallback) |
| vlm.qwen25_vl_7b | 82 | 8000 | missing (slot target) |
| matting.birefnet | 78 | 1000 | missing |
| seg.sam2 | 75 | 900 | missing |
| upscale.ultrasharp_4x | 70 | 70 | installed |

### Stable workflows (P1/P2)

| workflow_ref | score |
|--------------|------:|
| video_i2v.v1 | 76 |
| clothing_replace.v1 | 74 |
| object_replace.v1 / inpaint.v1 | 73 |
| instruction_edit.v1 | 72 |
| background_remove.v1 | 68 |
| video_i2v.v0_legacy | 65 |
| face_swap.v1 (beta) | 55 |
| video_v2v.experimental / video_extend.experimental | 0 |

Promotion rule: after fixture run, set `benchmark_estimated=false` on the record and update this table.
